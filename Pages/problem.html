          <h1>Where is it happening?</h1>
          <p>The area we are focusing on is the creek that runs underneath the Ormiston Bridge and the path that goes next to it in Barry Curtis Park. 
            There is a pathway leading through the bush that goes from the bridge and skatepark to the front-side of the town centre.</p>

          <h1>What is happening?</h1>
          <p>We think that the majority of the rubbish in these areas is the result of a lack of bins, 
            as well as the creek carrying rubbish when it swells. 
            Our theory was confirmed when we did a survey and found that the majority of students thought the same thing. 
            See solution page for analytics.</p>

          <h1>Masks</h1>
          <p>When we went to observe the areas, we noticed that an alarming percentage of the pollution was disposable masks. 
            This likely started all the way back in 2020 when the pandemic first started. 
            Because nobody cleans this area, the rubbish just piles up, and has piled up for 2 years now. 
            Taking on mask pollution alone would significantly reduce the overall pollution.</p>
