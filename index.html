          <h1>Who are we?</h1>
          <p>We are a group of students at Ormiston Senior College. We are apart of a digital media class.  
            As apart of our learning guide, we must choose a community issue and make a website that focuses on that.</p>

          <h1>What are we doing?</h1>
          <p>We plan on dealing with the litter situation in Barry Curtis Park. Specifically, 
            there is an area that goes from underneath the bridge to Whenua Rd that is full of rubbish. 
            As an extension, maybe we could also include the empty plot by the medical centre.</p>

          <h1>What is our solution?</h1>
          <p>Our solution largely revolves around getting the council to develop the park more and gathering volunteers.
